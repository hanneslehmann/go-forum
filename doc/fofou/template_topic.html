				<div class="post">Quote from Tech connect:  &#34;but when it comes to straight-up reading Portable Document Format files, Sumatra PDF is blazing-fast and completely accurate&#34;  
<br>
<br>THAT is why I love Sumatra PDF.   PLEASE keep it this way.  Foxit started out well, then went the way of the bloatware.  Please don&#39;t go down that road.</div>

				<div class="post">Agree! I love this PDF reader. I&#39;m a hardcore student and read a lot of pdf files. It is a nightmare to use Acrobat Reader because it is so slow on my low-spec laptop. Sumatra PDF is super fast. I use it everywhere I can, and keep it on a usb-stick for portable reading. Thank you. Keep the user interface simple like it is now.</div>

				<div class="post">I want to give my thumbs up to Sumatra reader as well. It is awesome, a huge improvement over Adobe Reader. I have been cursing Adobe for years and this has made my life so much easier. Thank you, thank you!! 
<br>
<br>Can I send a donation somewhere to keep this work going?

<br>An admirer and an ardent user.</div>

				<div class="post">I&#39;m just passing by to thank the developer(s) for this amazing piece of software. I think it has some useful features and strangely it all just works all the time. I still have not found any bugs after a few months of usage. Fun fact. I just tried to search for \vdash in a LaTeX PDF file by copying the symbol into the search bar. It didn&#39;t display it correctly in search, but it was able to find the symbol in the document!</div>
